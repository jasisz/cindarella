Self evolving story experiment.

Simple django project allowing to create story with template and number of features with multiple possible values.

When the story is shared - it mutates by itself and randomly changes some of those features values, becoming a new variant of story.

It is basically an evolutionary algorithm aiming to create best possible story from given template,
where sharing the story is kind of evaluating its fitness.
